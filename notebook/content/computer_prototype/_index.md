## Introduction: Bottle
The system we are designing is called Bottle. It is an anonymous audio-based venting platform to help social-media users express their thoughts and feelings without the pressures of maintaining their appearance or image. The idea is to mimic and recreate the experience of pouring your heart out in a letter, putting it in a bottle, and tossing it into the ocean for someone to find one day.

On this platform, users are able to record and share audio messages or “bottles” and anonymously share them with all other users of the system. On the other hand, users are also able to listen to bottles shared by other random users.

## Computer Prototype
Follow the instructions in the installation guide to set up the prototype for testing. A link to the prototype is included in the guide:  
<a href="../pdfs/computer/installation_guide.pdf" target="_blank">Installation Guide</a>  

Here is a manual describing the functionality of the prototype. Make sure you play around
with the prototype and understand how it works before conducting the tests with the users.

Next, please read the usability test plan, which includes all the information required
to conduct the tests. Additionally, read the reporting procedure below which describes
how to manage the collection and organisation of raw test data.
All required testing materials, and any other relevant documents are also provided below.

## Usability Evalutation
Once the usability test plan has been carried out, move on to the next step, which is 
usability evaluation. All relevant information for this step is included in the document below.
