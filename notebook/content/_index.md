**Bottle**  
The system we are designing is called Bottle. It is an anonymous audio-based venting platform to help social-media users express their thoughts and feelings without the pressures of maintaining their appearance or image. The idea is to mimic and recreate the experience of pouring your heart out in a letter, putting it in a bottle, and tossing it into the ocean for someone to find one day.

On this platform, users are able to record and share audio messages or “bottles” and anonymously share them with all other users of the system. On the other hand, users are also able to listen to audio messages shared by other random users.
